## Frequently Asked Questions

- What are the chances of collision?

If every human on Earth worked as a GUID generator, and they spent their entire working life generating guids at one guid per second, without even stopping for lunch, then by the time every human on earth had retired, the chances of a collision would be about 50%.


- Do guids make the best database identifiers?

Yes. But I don't use them much for that myself.

- Should you put GUIDs in URLs?

No. [Don't Put Guids in URLs](http://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls)
